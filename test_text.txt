Stop picking fights about things you don't really care about. 
Screaming about him not really liking your bandage dress is not helping anything, it's just making both of you feel confused about your emotions.

Be a generous compliment-giver. 
No one feels bad when you say they look great today or brag about their promotion in front of your friends. 
Do it more often.

Spend plenty of time with your friends. 
Yes, even at the beginning when you're totally obsessed with each other and just want to lick faces 24/7. 
You'll need your friends later and you don't want Jessica to bring up the nine months you ditched her for the rest of your life.

Go on dates. 
If 99 percent of your "dates" have become making dinner together then going home whenever he wakes you up from your couch nap, you need to plan a date. 
Go dancing. 
Go to a museum. 
Go apple picking. 
Whatever, just get out of the house and do something fun together.

Try new things together — even if it's just a new kind of food. 
To date, one of my favorite nights with my fiancé was the time he took me to an amusement park. 
Neither of us were ever into roller coasters, but we talked ourselves into going on a kind of small and lame one, and afterward we were both like, "I'M SO EXHILARATED AND I LOVE YOU!"

Go to their family/work events if you're invited. 
It's not that fun, but it's also not that hard and it'll mean a lot to your partner.

Get to know their friends in doses. 
Being in a new relationship means inheriting a whole new set of dude-friends. 
While that might seem exciting or overwhelming or just terrible, you don't have to put pressure on yourself to get to know everyone super quickly.

Make sure you tell them when something really matters to you. 
You can't be mad that they didn't come to your friend's birthday party if you told them, "My friend Cassie's having a party on Friday if you want to come." 
Be straight up: "My friend Cassie's having a party on Friday and it's really important to me that you come and meet my friends. Let's meet beforehand and go together." 
There, I fixed it.

Try sex things you've always wanted to try. 
Maybe you've always wanted to try anal sex or light bondage, but never wanted to bring it up with a casual boyfriend. 
Now's your time! 
You have a loving partner who you want to be with for the long haul and a currently missionary-only sex life! 
Ask him if he'll tie you up.

Don't only tell your friends about the negative sides of your relationship. 
It's easy to just bitch to your friends that JASON IS BEING SO ANNOYING RIGHT NOW, but if that's all you tell them, they'll think you have a pretty terrible partner. Plus talking shit behind his back will get back to him eventually.

Know that your partner doesn't have to be your best friend. 
Being a romantic partner is a lot of pressure. 
You have to be supportive and loving and also good in bed. 
Leave the best friend duties to your girlfriends and it'll take a lot of pressure off of him. 
Also: more time with your girlfriends is never a bad thing.

Don't judge their sex habits. 
It usually takes a while for someone to share their fantasies or porn habits with you. 
Don't scare them off by making them feel weird about whatever gets them off. 
Porn and fantasies are fiction.

Know that your first fight is not an indication of how it will be forever. 
Right now you're bickering about him not spending enough time with you. 
Next month you'll be busy and he'll be a little lonely. 
Don't stress.

Don't snoop. 
Everyone who snoops finds what they were looking for. 
If you think he's cheating and you hack into his Facebook, you will find some random message with an old female friend that you could probably construe as cheating somehow. 
Just don't do it. 
Even if they accidentally left their Gmail open on your computer and you're drooling to read through it.

Apologize when you know you're wrong. 
Yeah, it probably will blow over after a while, but if you don't solve a fight and just let it simmer it will come to a boil again at some point.

If you hit an awkward spot, do something fun together to remind you both of why you started dating in the first place. 
Sometimes it feels like, "Whyyyy did we ever even start dating we hate each otherrrrr." 
That's when you plan a fun date that's reminiscent of the stuff you used to do when you first started dating. 
It'll take your minds off your differences and remind you why you love each other.

Treating your guy to a lap dance should be hot...but actually giving one can be, well, awkward. 
So we asked Kimberly Smith, owner of StripXpertease, a studio offering striptease classes in New York City, to give us the simple moves that'll make his jaw come unhinged.

Choose your song — something slow but sexy (think anything by Kings of Leon) will do the trick. 
And don't feel obligated to make your lap dance last an entire song. 
Usually 60-90 seconds is all you need (and all he can take before he bursts through his pants). 
Then put a chair against the wall — you'll need to use the wall for support — and have your guy sit in it so that his legs are spread open. 
You'll want to stay within that triangle-shaped space between his thighs as you try these moves:

In the quaint villages snuggling amidst the romantic forest and mountain regions of the Rhineland, many strange, mystic
legends of fairies and ghostly visitants were once firmly believed in by the simple peasants who dwelt therein. Even at
the beginning of the nineteenth century, these country folk carefully kept away from any lonely spots said to be haunted 
by such uncanny beings - especially so after darkness had fallen.

One of the most curious of these strange legends concerned that of the Wilis who were said to reveal themselves in many
a forest glade from midnight until four o'clock in the morning. The Wilis were believed to be the ghostly sylph-like
spirits of young maidens who had been deserted or deceived by their lovers and had died of grief before their wedding
bells had chimed - and, in particular, of girls who had had a great love of dancing in their former lives. The Wilis
spent most of their hours as sylphs in dancing together in a maze of wonderfuls formations, their ethereal figures in
filmy draperies weaving endless patterns as they floated over the flower-starred emerald grass.

But, lovely though they were to look at, the Wilis kept up a dangerous grudge against all the male mortals they came in
contact with. If any young man happened to be out alone in the forest late at night and was unlucky enough to fall in
with a group of Wilis dancing as sylphs in the moonlight, he was never seen alive again. The dancing phantoms would
quickly surround him and compel him to join in their giddy whirling movements until he became too exhausted to recover
and, at last, fell to the ground, dead.

Consequently, at the time when the story opens, in the early part of the nineteenth century, it was no wonder that most
of the young men in one of these pretty Rhineland villages were still unwilling to find themselves out after midnight in 
forest glades said to be haunted by the Wilis. Even the girls were often warned by their parents to be careful to avoid 
such danger spots - especially if they happened to be unusually fond of dancing. It was believed in this village that 
girls with a passion for dancing were more brokenhearted, than those who did not care whether they danced or not.

One of the girls most frequently warned about this was a fair young maiden named Giselle, who, besides being the best
dancer, was also the prettiest girl in the village.

So beautiful indeed, was this young peasant maiden, Giselle, that she already had two sweethearts. One of these was
Hilarion, a forest- ranger or game-keeper, who had loved her deeply for a long time and was hoping to become betrothed
to her in due course. Of late, however, he had felt that Giselle was no longer interested in him, as was formerly the
case, and that he had a rival.

This was the truth. The beautiful Giselle had recently attracted the attention and admiration of Albrecht, the handsome
young Duke of Silesia, whose Castle overlooked the village; and he soon fell desperately in love with her. But there
were more difficulties in the way of his romance. In the first place, he was already betrothed to the proud Princess
Bathilde of Courland, whom he was expected to marry at some not too distant date. Secondly, he was aware that his high
social position would not permit of his marriage with a peasant maid. Nevertheless, he had conceived so deep a passion
for the beautiful Giselle that he was determined to see her as frequently as possible; and he hoped to win her love.

Suspecting that the simple village beauty might be unwilling to meet him as the powerful Duke of that district, and also
wishing to keep his sweet romance a secret for the time being, he devised a plan of action with the help of his
favourite attendant, a young squire named Wilfred. He made use of an empty cottage which stood opposite the rustic home
of Giselle and her mother, Berthe. Here he would arrive secretly and discard his fine clothes as a young lord; and then
he would issue forth from the cottage dressed in the simple grab of a peasant. Thus disguised, he made the acquaintance
of Giselle, to whom he introduced himself as Loys, a rustic youth.

So charming was the newcomer that Giselle all too quickly fell in love with him; and she believed the handsome Loys to
be indeed a peasant such as hilarion and her other village friends.

The lovers met many times, and their ecstatic happiness increased with every meeting. Giselle danced now more than ever
before, and was overjoyed on discovering that her beloved Loys was likewise a splendid dancer. He was infinitely more
graceful than any of the village youths who had formerly been her partners.

Buy Hilarion, the game-keeper, was far from happy. He became furiously jealous whenever he saw Giselle in the company of
the stranger, Loys. He also nursed dark suspicions of the latter, not knowing whence he came nor why he had appeared so
unexpectantly in the village. Full of mistrust, he determined to keep a close watch upon the hated newcomer who had so
quickly stolen away from him the heart of the village belle. He believed him to be a masquerader.

Another person likewise uneasy in his mind was the squire attendant, Wilfred, who felt that the young Duke's secret
romance could not long remain hidden and that it might end disastrously.

One morning, therefore, the anxious Wilfred endeavoured to persuade Albrecht to abandon his dangerous deception; but the
latter refused to listen to his wise counsel and angrily ordered him to return to the Castle and attend to certain
urgent matters there. And Wilfred perforce had to obey; but he departed with a heavy heart, full of foreboding.

Then Albrecht waited for Giselle to come forth from her cottage home; and when the fair maiden presently appeared the
happy lovers talked and danced together, full of ecstasy.

Meanwhile, Hilarion, who had been lurking in the backgroung and watching them, could restrain himself no longer; and
gull of jealous envy at the sight of the happy lovers, he noe rushed forth and boldly denounced the stranger Loys as an
unknown adventurer not to be trusted. Then he retreated his former sweetheart to have nothing to do with the newcomer,
but to accept his own deep and long-lasting love instead.

But Giselle had already given her heart to the handsome stranger and had eyes for no one else; and when Hilarion
presently began roughly to upbraid her in his own jealous disappointment, the pretended Loys attacked him instantly and
soon drove him back to the forest paths. The disguised Duke then returned to his beloved one, and the lovers were joyful
together once more.

Presently, the happy pair were joined by a lively group of village lads and maidens carrying baskets of grapes - for it
was the vintage season; and the whole party, quickly realising how matters stood between the newcomer and their own
lovely Queen of the Village, rejoiced with them, dancing and singing in the most hilarious manner.

Presently, Berthe, the somewhat severe mother of Giselle, disturbed by the noise, came forth from her cottage to see
what was afoot and to chide the young people for their over-exuberance. Like Hilarion, she did not approve of the
handsome stranger who had so recently and unaccountably appeared in their midst; and she now commanded Giselle to return
to her home and to her neglected work. She scolded her roundly for thus wasting her time - even declaring warningly that
the young girl might presently be transformed into a Wili, if she continued to dance so frequently - and extravagantly.

The merry party thus broke up and departed; and Albrecht, satisfied that his disguise as Loys the peasant was still a
safe one, wandered off into the woodlands, hoping to see his beloved Giselle again later on.

Very soon afterwards, the sound of hunting-horns was heard; and presently a formal hunting-party arrived upon the scene,
headed by the Prince of Courland and his daughter, the Princess Bathilde. Among the party was the Duke's squire,
Wilfred, who appeared anxious and troubled because his young master had not returned to the Castle in time to receive
these important visitors and to join in their sport.

To conceal his anxiety somewhat, Wilfred arranged for some light refreshment to be brought out from Berthe's cottage for
the enjoyment of the Princess and her royal father. This was set out upon a rustic table; and the high-born visitors
condescendingly sat down to refresh themselves.

When Giselle presently appeared, curtseying shyly, the great lady talked to her with pleasant interest- totally unaware
that the somewhat awed maiden was her rival in the affections of the young Duke, her betrothed; and presently, she
graciously slipped her own jewelled necklace around the neck of the pretty peasant girl, to the latter's great delight.

The aristocratic guests now accepted Berthe's respectful invitation to rest a short time in her humble abode; and when
they had retired into the cottage and the huntsman had strolled off into the forest, Giselle returned alone to look for
her beloved Loys. She soon saw him approaching eagerly towards her; and the reunited lovers once more danced with the
youthful peasants, who had likewise returned.

But tragedy was already in their midst. The jealous and suspicious Hilarion had, meanwhile, found an opportunity for
making his way, unobserved, into the stranger youth's cottage; and he now rushed forth therefrom in a furious rage, and
stopped the dancing. He then flung down before Giselle and her lover the latter's rich garments as a Duke, together with
his bejewelled sword, declaring that he had found these suspicious objects in the cottage of the stranger, proving that
the latter was no peasant but a nobleman of high degree. Next, he blew a loud blast upon a hunting-horn, which quickly
brought back the strolling huntsmen, and likewise caused the Prince of Courland and his daughter to come forth from the
cottage in haste.

Thus the young Duke's masquerade came to end, since he was instantly recognised by the amazed Bathilde and all the royal
party as her betrothed, despite the peasant garb he was wearing; and an angry scene followed.

But soon anger changed to dismay. The beautiful Giselle was so overcome by grief and shame as she realised her deception
by the young Duke and now learned also that the Princess Bathilde was, in truth, his betrothed future wife, that she
snatched the jewelled chain from her neck and flung it away as she sank to the ground in a paroxysm of sobs.

Then, before the now remorseful Albrecht could reach her side, she sprang up once more and began to fling herself about
and to dash hither and thither in a dance of such utter madness that the alarmed company quickly realised that the
terrible shock she had received had disturbed the balance of her mind and that she had, indeed, lost her reason. As
though living in the recent past, she enacted some of the scenes of her tragic deception - to the frantic grief of
Albrecht, who vainly implored her forgiveness and endeavoured to calm her. But the distraught girl broke away from his
restraining arms almost in horror; and snatching up his sword she plunged the point of it into her breast.

Then, with her last remaining strength, she continued her wild dance. Nobody could stop her uncontrolled but beautifully
rhythmic movements; and all the sympathetic spectators could do was to gaze upon the distracted girl in awe-struck
horror - in particular, her once severe but now unhappy mother, Berthe, who wrung her hands in the deepest distress, but
was powerless to prevent the sad fate she had only so recently predicted for her beautiful and beloved daughter.

Then came the tragic climax. Even as the horror-struck company gazed upon the madly-whirling girl, Giselle suddenly
stopped and wavered uncertainly for a moment or two; then, uttering a soft sigh, she fell back, dead, into the arms of
her weeping mother.

A short time after this sad tragedy, another hunting party was in progress one moonlit night; and the huntsmen, led by
the game-keeper, Hilarion, were so eager about their sport that they lingered in the forest much later than usual and
lost their way.

Presently, they all trooped into a deep mysterious glade, at one side of which stood a newly-made grave on a little
mound in a sheltered spot. A small cross had been placed at the head of the grave; and upon this holy symbol appeared
the one word, "Giselle."

The huntsmen, however, did not notice the newly made grave of the unhappy Giselle; but feeling that this was a somewhat
eerie spot into which they had wandered, they began to shiver slightly. Their uneasiness increased presently when
Hilarion informed them that this part of the forest was believed to be haunted by those strange unearthly beings, the
Wills - those dangerously transformed maidens who had been unlucky in love and had died before their wedding-days had
dawned, and who were doomed by a magic enchantment to lure mortal young men to a last fatal dance with them.

The huntsmen were now thoroughly alarmed, for midnight was fast approaching, the hour when the Wilis were due to appear;
and, in haste, they hurried away, followed by Hilarion, all hoping to escape in time. Scarcely had the young men
departed than the chimes of midnight sounded faintly from the distant village; and instantly, the haunted glade became
filled with the floating ethereal sylph-like forms of the Wills, gliding in noiselessly from every side like will-o
'-the-wisps.

They were led by Myrta, Queen of the Wilis, who bade them follow her to the newly-made grave of the beautiful Giselle,
their new companion, whom she now proceeded to call forth, waving her magic wand as she did so.

Almost immediately, the ghostly form of Giselle appeared in their midst - an airy-fairy sprite now clad in misty, filmy
draperies and having small white wings between her shoulders. She was already a Willi; and she felt light as air as she
joined her newly-found sister- Wilis in their wonderful dances.

They were all fated to dance continuously until four o'clock, when they would vanish once more, until midnight came
again.

As the Wills presently danced away down the glade, the young Duke Albrecht came into it from the other side, attended by
his faithful squire, Wilfred.

He was now very contrite and sorrowful, for he had truly loved the gentle Giselle, and was full of sincere remorse for
having been the cause of her tragic end. Having learned that her simple grave was in this forest glade, he had now come
to lay a wreath of lilies at the foot of the little white cross. He had also lost his way, and so had arrived thus late
in the glade.

Wilfred, knowing that his beloved master was in danger in this haunted spot now that midnight had chimed, begged him to
leave the glade quickly; but Albrecht refused to do so. Instead, he commanded Wilfred to return to the Castle
immediately, and to leave him alone with his dead beloved one; and the young squire had no choice but to obey.

When Wilfred had reluctantly departed, the unhappy Duke moved forward and laid his wreath of lilies upon the little
white cross at the head of Giselle's grave; and he remained standing there for a short time, his head bowed with grief.
Then, looking up, he suddenly beheld his beloved one, more beautiful than ever in her Wili form; and he was instantly
full of joy once more.

The glade was now filled with the sylph-like figures of her companion Wills, all dancing and holding high revels; but
Albrecht had eyes for none but his lovely Giselle, whom he chased hither and thither - for she kept teasingly vanishing
and then appearing again.

At last, however, she took pity upon him and allowed him to join her in a wonderful fairy-like dance-having first made
sure that her sylph companions had danced away to the other end of the glade and that she was alone with her former
lover.

The other Wilis, indeed, were fully occupied. They had found and surrounded the young game-keeper, Hilarion, who, over-
venturesome, had returned to the glade alone to look for the grave of Giselle; and, seizing him in triumph as their
lawful prize, they compelled him to dance with them until he fell, dying from exhaustion. Then they tossed him
laughingly into a dark pool nearby - it being their dreadful fate and duty as Wilis thus to lure young men to their
doom.

Presently. they returned with their Queen to deal with the other mortal youth they already knew to be in their haunted
glade.

Seeing them coming, and knowing their terrible intention, Giselle frantically bade Albrecht cling to the little cross on
her grave, this being a symbol of Sanctuary, while she herself stood over him and tried to save him from destruction.

The Queen of the Wilis now became furious, since her magic wand had no power over one who clung to the cross; but she
still had power over each and all of her subject Wilis. Therefore, she sternly bade the trembling Giselle to lure the
Duke away from the cross by means of her own unearthly beauty and exquisite dancing.

Unable to disobey this absolute command of her Queen, since she was herself now an avenging Will, the unhappy sprite was
thus compelled to lure her mortal lover away from the cross to his doom by revealing to him the irresistible grace of
her movements in sylph form. Her agonised pleas for mercy having been scornfully rejected, and under the cold stony
glances of the implacable Myrta, she found herself forced to dance in a most seductive and exciting manner which the
young Duke was powerless to resist; and, all too soon, he joined her, even with eagerness.

Never before had such marvellous dancing been seen in the haunted glade as that of Giselle and Albrecht; and the revel
became madder than ever as the other Wilis surrounded the whirling pair and enticed them on to faster and wilder
movements.

This exciting and most enthralling dance continued for a very long time; but at last Albrecht began to falter and
realised that his waning strength was ebbing fast. And still the unhappy Giselle was compelled by renewed commands of
the vengeful Will Queen, Myrta, to continue her alluring movements, ever faster and more furious, even though she knew
her beloved one was gradually failing and that his mortal strength was already almost exhausted.

Then, at last, she saw that the first pale flicker of early dawn was beginning to enter the haunted glade; and the
chimes of four o'clock were now faintly heard striking from the distant village church clock. Would the sinister design
of the Will Queen now be frustrated?

Instantly, with the coming of dawn, the power of the Wills left them, and they had to return to their graves until the
following midnight.

Gradually, the haunted glade was deserted; and as the Wilis, still dancing, vanished from sight, Albrecht fell to the
ground. Giselle longed to remain with him and help him to recover; but she found herself powerless to do so, since she
was now a Wili and must return to her grave. Compelled against her will, and powerless to resist the magic spell, she
moved, slowly and reluctantly, away from her lover's side.

The prostrate Albrecht made a last despairing effort to keep her with him. He even managed to struggle painfully to his
feet once more and follow her; then, sorrowfully realising that they could not fight against the magic of the Wills, he
resigned himself to their sad parting.

As the lovely sylph form of Giselle vanished from sight behind the little white cross on her grave - around which sweet-
scented flowers were already blossoming - her exhausted mortal lover again fell prostrate to the ground above.

Statistically, what's the best way to avoid crushing loneliness? Nothing gives you more anxiety than seeing data about
how you're going to spend the rest of your life alone. Should you meet someone at a bar? What is the probability of
finding the love of your life online? What if the love of your life lives in Japan? What if there's a language barrier
between you and your soul mate, and you'll never be happy because you'll never find The One? These are all relevant,
rational questions everyone thinks about.

How do I ask someone out without coming off like a creepy stalker or like I don't care at all? How do we even toe that
line?Even after we find someone we're into, asking her out is a whole other question. Do we try to play it smooth and
bold, and potentially scare her off too soon? Do we avoid saying anything for three years? Do we get her number and text
her a bunch until she finally asks to hang out? The options are numerous and stress-inducing.

Does this look like I dressed up or like my mom dressed me up? "What does this shirt say about me as a person?" we ask
ourselves longingly as we stare into the mirror. We have to have a rugged but boyish charm. We need to look good without
looking like we tried to look good. Ultimately, we need to wear a dress shirt and jeans.

Is a condom in the wallet a good idea? We don't want to look cocky or presumptuous if she happens to see a condom
sticking out of our wallet, but we also don't want to be without one, just in case.

How drunk is just drunk enough? Should we order a few beers? Can we get so drunk that this date is no longer awkward?
Will she judge us if we pass out in the bathroom for half an hour?

Will we be able to talk about anything beyond our favorite colors and our jobs? It's not like we need to have a
passionate and undying love for the same hockey team, but if we can't both sit at our table and make fun of what the
other patrons are wearing, we're going to run out of "what do you do for a living" small talk rather quickly.

What if the restaurant is too expensive, like five-dollar-signs-on- Yelp expensive? Yeah, we made the recommendation and
intend to pick up the check, but what if the restaurant is even more than we thought? What if she picks the most
expensive thing on the menu? What if our card gets declined? If we sprint out of the restaurant, will she follow? If we
can psychically orchestrate a dine-and-dash on the first date, we're probably soul mates.

How do I establish that I'm a badass with a heart of gold? In a perfect date situation, we get the opportunity to pull
off some awesome date move that makes her fall in love instantly. Maybe we'll have the opportunity to clothesline a
purse-snatcher as they run by or reenact that whole "Twist and Shout" scene from Ferris Bueller's Day Off.

What if you talk about your ex? What if I talk about my ex? What if an ex shows up to the date? The only thing worse
than having nothing to talk about is hearing about an ex she's clearly not over, or we go on and on about our exes. What
was supposed to be a date turns into a therapy session.

What if I spend the night alone at the restaurant petrified of making eye contact with anyone else because I get stood
up? "Oh, me? No, I'm not waiting for anyone! I just got all dressed up and came to this place to play Flappy Bird on my
phone while I sit at a table by myself."

Is there such a thing as too many bathroom breaks? What if we have to pee in the middle of dinner and leave you alone?
What if we have to do that more than once? What's worse: leaving the table multiple times or peeing our pants?

What if my favorite joke doesn't get any laughs? There are few things as quiet as the silence that falls over two people
after one of them tells a joke the other person doesn't find funny. It's the sound of a kitten gently walking on freshly
fallen snow, crying silent tears.

Is she different than my first impression? What if that great first impression was a complete fluke? Maybe we were both
really drunk, and bonding over the game of Survivor Flip Cup we won together isn't a solid foundation for a
relationship.

What if she's not impressed with us? What have I even accomplished? Should I bring my old soccer trophies to show off
casually? We don't want to disappoint. What is it you even like about us, and how do we play that up as much as possible
and downplay literally everything else?

What if I completely forget how to kiss? I'm pretty sure most people just black out when going in for a kiss and go
straight from leaning in to kissing because the whole idea of a first kiss is so awkward your brain shuts down as a
defense mechanism.

What if there's a second date? There's a sense of relief when we have that moment where we get to leave an awkward date
and walk out into the night. We know we'll never see each other again, and it feels kind of like getting off a roller
coaster: It might have been touch and go there for a while, but we survived. Way scarier is the prospect that the date
went well, which means a second date, which means we have to start this process all over again…

Either you're in a super-dark place, or this subtle signal means he's into you. 
"Dilation is a brain response that occurs when you like and are attracted to something,"

People tend to use this subconscious expression to help open their eyes when they like what they see. If he raises his brows ever so slightly while you're talking, it means he's interested in whatever you're saying.

"Guys stop smiling like this around the age of 5 — unless they're really happy, Wood says. He might not show off a toothy grin while casually flirting, but on a really awesome date when he's having loads of fun? Look for teeth: When he feels really happy, he's not covering that up,

Real smiles extend well beyond the mouth: They lift the forehead and give you slightly squinty eyes. 
If his smile involves his whole face, it means you're genuinely affecting him in a good way.

He licks his lips in a cute (not creepy) way. When you're attracted to someone, your mouth produces extra saliva, Wood says. 
In response, hemight quickly lick his lips or press them together. 
(Slower = creepster.)

He locks eyes with your face — not your eyes. 
You might think that a guy who is totally enamored by you will find it hard to peel his eyes away. 
But now that everyone is used to being glued to their phones, nonstop eye contact can make people feel uncomfortable. 
So, new rule: If he spends about 80 percent of your interaction looking from your eyes to your nose and lips, he's into you,

He takes a deep breath when he sees you. 
Yes, men do require oxygen.
But when he subconsciously takes a deep breath — he'll pull in his stomach and puff out his chest — it's a subconscious way to make his upper body look broader and his waist look smaller, two qualities that make him look more fit and (from an evolutionary perspective) more desirable, Wood says. 
In other words, he's into you and he's trying to attract you.

He leans toward you when you talk. 
In a noisy bar, this sign might not hold much weight. 
But when he can physically hear you perfectly well and leans in anyway, it means he's interested in what you have to say — and you, in general.

He puts his hands on his hips with his elbows out to the sides.
Because this stance takes up more space than standing with your arms against your sides, Wood says this is a male power signal that guys use to show physical superiority over other guys. 
It means he's seeking attention. 
And if he does it while he's angled toward you?
He's seeking it from you.

He touches your knee ("Soft pants!") or tucks your hair behind your ear. 
When he initiates physical contact under the guise of another reason, it's a test to see how you respond to his touch, Wood says.
Because touch is a tool he uses to test your limits, it could mean he's only interested in sex, Wood says. 
If he really likes you, though, he might pull back extra-slowly and smile sweetly as he does it, which means he wants to take the time to get closer to you.

He sits with his legs spread. 
Because this position exposes his man parts, which are full of sensitive nerve endings, it's a vulnerable position that could mean he's willing to put himself out there (literally and emotionally) to get to know you.

He angles his pelvis toward you. 
Because the pelvis is overtly sexual, Wood says, it often signals sexual interest — or lack thereof. 
If he angles his hips away from you, it's probably the latter.

He points his toes toward you. 
Because the feet are involved in the fight-or-flight response that kicks in when you're in danger, they're largely controlled by the unconscious mind — and can be very telling in social interactions. 
"The feet tend to point where the heart want to go," Wood says. 
Of course, timing is super important in interpreting the feet: If you're talking to a guy who seems interested, you touch his arm, and then see his feet angle away from you, the context says he's no longer interested.

He crosses his legs. 
If he crosses them in a way that turns his torso and upper body away from you, he might be disinterested. 
But if he crosses his legs away and turns the rest of his body toward you, it could just mean that he's shy, depending on the guy.

He sort of shuffles toward you while you're talking. 
He obviously wants to get closer to you.

He talks to you without facing you. 
Wood says this could be a sign he's keeping his options open. 
But don't rush to judge a great conversationalist just because he chats you up while he faces forward.
If he makes an effort to find a common thread or asks you lots of questions, his body language may reflect his personality (shy), and he could actually be totally enthralled by you.

He touches his throat. 
The throat represents communication and vulnerability, Wood says. 
If he reaches up to touch it during your interaction, he's interested in you and worried about coming across well. 
But again, context can play a role here. 
If you're talking to Mr. Slick, a throat touch could signal dishonesty. 
So feel him out, and look for other signs on this list before you go reassure him.

When he holds your hand, he presses his palm against yours. 
This kind of full-fledged hand-holding signifies a desire to connect. 
The same goes for interlocking fingers, while an arched palm means he's scared or may be holding something back (literally).

He grazes your forearm while he's talking. 
The message is loud and clear: He wants your attention, be it to impress you or to make sure you're listening — because he wants to be heard.

He walks beside you. 
If he's constantly two steps ahead of you, it means he's more concerned about himself than you, Wood says. 
Unless he's leading you through a scary or crowded space, he should adjust his pace to match yours.

It's become sort of the norm to hand-hug your phone when out. Ah,
gotta Instagram that meal. But when you're on a date, don't do it. It
lets him think that he doesn't have your attention and that you're
just not into him.

You might be nervous—or you might have a short attention span. If your
date notices that you're constantly scanning the room, he'll think
you're bored.

Pauses in a conversation can be, well, awkward. By trying to avoid the
silence, you might end up chatting non-stop about yourself. Do this
and he'll think you're way too self-absorbed and have no plans on
getting to know him and his interests. Instead, ask him questions
about himself and let the convo flow.

Sometimes that curry you shared doesn't sit well. And yeah, that's
awkward. Sure, you don't have to give gory details, but rushing out
without telling a guy why makes him think you're over it. Try, "I've
had a great time and I'd love to do this again, but I'm not feeling
well. I think I need to call it an early night."

Sure, playing hard to get can work. But if you don't want him to play
games, don't do it either. When he reaches out, get back to him within
an hour or two.

While most guys will end up footing the bill, they still want their
girl to offer to pay. Being stubborn and not wanting to pay will make
you come off as high-maintenance. And no guy wants to get involved
with a girl that might be too much work.
