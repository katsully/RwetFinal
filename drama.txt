15 signs you're the drama queen of your friendship group
You can't get a tickly cough without Googling your symptoms and announcing your imminent death. Your mates have to physically hold you back from your laptop to prevent you self-diagnosing your rare and fatal strain of something-or-other. 
You've spent more than one night out with mates crying in the toilets over some kind of booze-induced drama. Your mates have been known to secretly water down your booze to prevent setting you off. 
You constantly get accused of overreacting. It's not your fault you were born an over-thinking, highly-strung explosion of emotion. 
You pride yourself on your dramatic Facebook announcements. 
But without a bit of drama, wouldn't life be a bore?!
