How to Keep a Long-Distance Relationship Strong and Sexy
We're not even gonna try to candy-coat it, because if you've been there, and you know: LDRs suck. That said, there are definitely ways to make them more manageable, even, dare we say, fun! 
Each couples has different communication needs, so decide how often you'll talk (maybe it's every day, maybe every other day with texting and ). 
Schedule calls in advance, and set aside other activities (ahem, turn off the Facebook feed!) so you can really focus on the conversation, just like you would if you were in the same place.
Don't fall into the trap of dwelling on how much you miss each other and how hard it is to be apart. While it's healthy to express those feelings, to maintain a sense of normalcy and closeness it's equally important to talk about random, happy stuff that's going on. 
Send each other quick texts—like that you just had the best sandwich ever, or totally wiped out on the subway—and bring up the kind of mundane details you'd fill each other in on at the end of the day if you lived together.
It's bad enough to fight with your guy and not be able to see or touch him, but it's even worse if you can't hear his voice…so never argue via text or IM. If you're upset about something, discuss it over the phone—or even better on FaceTime or Skype. 
Remember that because you can't read each other's body language, you'll need to really listen, as well as be super honest about how you feel.
Be open about your goals in life and for the relationship. 
If one of you is hoping to eventually live in the same place and get married, while the other is looking for a fun escape during business travel, things aren't going to work out in the end.
