We assign qualities to people based on very little information (he
lives in a certain area, has a certain job, acts a certain way in
public) and believe those qualities are what we need in a guy. I've
met people who have said, "I would never date a shy guy," assuming he
would be boring, and then realized the person was interesting and
funâ€”he just wasn't as outgoing as their usual "type."

When you go out with the same type of guy, expecting different results
from the ones who have burned you before. You'll know your pattern
isn't working for you if you're constantly playing the same
frustrating role in your relationships. We need to stop focusing on
who the guy we're dating is and look at who we are with him. Are you
crazier than you'd like to be? More confused than ever? Focus on how
you act around him to see if your pattern is working.

You have to be honest with yourself to figure out what your pattern is
before you can break it. Ask yourself: If my dating life were a movie,
how would it begin and end? What character do I always play? You'll
get some clues. It's normal to get into patterns, even self-defeating
ones. After you identify your pattern, make a commitment to get
outside of your comfort zone so you can break it. Do things you don't
usually do and go to places you don't usually go to meet people.

Yes. That's not to say settle for less than you want. Decide what your
three "must haves" are and your three "can't stands" and simply be
open to the fact that those qualities may come in different packages.
