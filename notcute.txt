It's become sort of the norm to hand-hug your phone when out. Ah,
gotta Instagram that meal. But when you're on a date, don't do it. It
lets him think that he doesn't have your attention and that you're
just not into him.

You might be nervousâ€”or you might have a short attention span. If your
date notices that you're constantly scanning the room, he'll think
you're bored.

Pauses in a conversation can be, well, awkward. By trying to avoid the
silence, you might end up chatting non-stop about yourself. Do this
and he'll think you're way too self-absorbed and have no plans on
getting to know him and his interests. Instead, ask him questions
about himself and let the convo flow.

Sometimes that curry you shared doesn't sit well. And yeah, that's
awkward. Sure, you don't have to give gory details, but rushing out
without telling a guy why makes him think you're over it. Try, "I've
had a great time and I'd love to do this again, but I'm not feeling
well. I think I need to call it an early night."

Sure, playing hard to get can work. But if you don't want him to play
games, don't do it either. When he reaches out, get back to him within
an hour or two.

While most guys will end up footing the bill, they still want their
girl to offer to pay. Being stubborn and not wanting to pay will make
you come off as high-maintenance. And no guy wants to get involved
with a girl that might be too much work.
